# Employee Directory

## Overview
Employee directory created with React. Break up application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## How It Works
Click on the NAME category to organize the users by such category, and keep on clicking to change from ascending to descending order.
You can search by email, name, or phone of the user.
